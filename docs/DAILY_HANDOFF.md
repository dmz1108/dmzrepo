# Daily Handoff Log

This file is the GitHub-side handoff log for Codex, Claude, and any future AI collaborator.

Use this file for code collaboration context: what changed, why it changed, which files were touched, what was validated, and what the next agent needs to know.

Use the cloud server operation log for production-only actions such as `git pull`, service restarts, scheduler changes, cloud firewall/port changes, runtime config changes, or data-sync operations.

Cloud operation logs currently live on the production server under:

- `C:\PandaDashboard\panda-cloud-ops-2026-06-19.md`
- `C:\PandaDashboard\_cloud-change-log-20260705.md`

## Required Entry Format

Append a new entry after every meaningful task.

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD - Agent Name - Short task title

Changed:
- ...

Files:
- `path/to/file`

Validated:
- ...

Deployment:
- Not deployed / Deployed to cloud / GitHub only

Notes for next agent:
- ...
```

## Rules

- Keep entries concise but specific.
- Mention every file intentionally changed.
- State whether production was touched.
- State whether the server was restarted.
- Do not write secrets, tokens, passwords, cookies, SMTP credentials, private keys, or runtime-only data into this file.
- If production-only data or config is needed, say what is needed without including the secret value.
- If a task changes cloud runtime state, also update the cloud operation log.

## 2026-07-06 - Codex - Added shared GitHub handoff workflow

Changed:
- Added this GitHub-side daily handoff log.
- Updated Claude/Codex onboarding rules so future work records both code context and deployment/runtime status.

Files:
- `docs/DAILY_HANDOFF.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/CLAUDE_HANDOFF_EN.md`

Validated:
- Confirmed the repository already contains the 41-file sanitized seed.
- Prepared this file as the standard place for future GitHub-side collaboration notes.

Deployment:
- GitHub only.
- Not deployed to the cloud server.
- No service restart.

Notes for next agent:
- Append to this file after each task.
- If you deploy or alter production runtime state, also update the cloud server operation log.
